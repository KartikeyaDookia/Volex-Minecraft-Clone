# 🧱 Volex – Minecraft-Inspired Voxel Engine in Python

A lightweight **voxel-based game engine** inspired by **Minecraft**, built using **Python** and powerful libraries like `pygame`, `moderngl`, `numba`, and `pyGLM`. Volex is a sandbox 3D world where blocks, terrain, and movement come together in real time — all written from scratch.
